# 🩺 MedAssist – Medical Chatbot (NLP Knowledge-Based Assistant)

MedAssist is a lightweight medical chatbot built using **Streamlit** that provides general health guidance through **NLP-based keyword and symptom matching**.  
It retrieves answers from a curated medical knowledge file (`medical_data.txt`) and supports **multi-symptom queries** such as:

- Fever + Cold  
- Headache + Cough  
- Diabetes + Hypertension  

⚠️ This chatbot is for **educational purposes only** and does not replace professional medical advice.
